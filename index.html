<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    Ragu:

    1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced
    
    ½ cup diced carrot
    
    ½ cup diced celery
    
    ½ cup diced yellow onion
    
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    
    7 ounces ground beef
    
    6 ounces ground pork
    
    ½ cup dry red wine
    
    1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce
    
    2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed
    Pasta:
    
    ¼ cup water
    
    1 pinch salt
    
    ½ (8 ounce) package frozen spinach
    
    ½ (16 ounce) package gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
    
    2 medium eggs, at room temperature
    
    salt to taste
    
    ½ cup whole milk
    Bechamel Sauce:
    
    ⅓ cup unsalted butter
    
    ⅓ cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
    
    2 cups whole milk
    
    ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
    
    ⅛ teaspoon salt
    
    1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
   
    <ol>step 1</ol>
    <p> pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.<p>
    <ol>step 2</ol>
    <p> wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.<p>
